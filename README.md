ouRPerlGame
===========
<br>
<br>
The Perl game all of my friends have been helping me create by giving their ideas.
<br> 
Currently it's a gigantic fucking alpha. If you would like to help, just let me know.
<br>
<br>
Steps to use
<br>
1) Currently the sounds only work on osx because I'm utilizing /usr/bin/afplay in several spots.
<br>
2) You will need some modules. I personally love to use Cpanminus
<br>
2a) Cpanminus - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/master/cpanm
<br>
2b) To install Cpanminus: <b>curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus</b>
<br>
2c) To install the required modules: 
<br>
<b>sudo cpanm Term::ANSIColor Term::ExtendedColor Term::ReadKey Curses::UI</b>
<br>
3) To run the game, first grant the execute permission:  <b>chmod +x ouRPG.pl</b>
<br>
4) Then, run the game: <b>./ouRPG.pl</b>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for checking this out!
