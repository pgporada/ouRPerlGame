ouRPerlGame
===========

The Perl game all of my friends have been helping me create by giving their ideas.

Steps to use
1) Currently the sounds only work on osx because I'm utilizing /usr/bin/afplay in several spots.
2) To run the game, first grant the execute permission:  <b>chmod +x map.pl</b>
3) Then, run the game: <b>./map.pl<b>
