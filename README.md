ouRPerlGame
===========
<br>
<br>
The Perl game all of my friends have been helping me create by giving their ideas.
<br>
<br>
Steps to use
<br>
1) Currently the sounds only work on osx because I'm utilizing /usr/bin/afplay in several spots.
<br>
2) To run the game, first grant the execute permission:  <b>chmod +x map.pl</b>
<br>
3) Then, run the game: <b>./map.pl<b>
<br>
