ouRPerlGame
===========
The Perl game all of my friends have been helping me create by giving their ideas.
<br>
<b>I PROPOSED TO MY FIANCE WITH THIS GAME AND SHE SAID YES!</b>
<br> 
<h2>Steps to use</h2>
<br>
<b>1)</b> Currently the sounds only work on osx because I'm utilizing /usr/bin/afplay in several spots.
<br>
<b>2)</b> You will need some modules. I like to use cpanminus
<br>
<b>2a)</b> Cpanminus - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/master/cpanm
<br>
<b>2b)</b> To install Cpanminus on a Unix based system: 
<br>
<b>curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus</b>
<br>
<b>2c)</b> To install the required modules: 
<br>
<b>sudo cpanm Term::ANSIColor Term::ExtendedColor Term::ReadKey Switch Term::Screen</b>
<br>
<b>3)</b> To run the game, grant the execute permission:  <b>chmod +x ouRPG.pl</b>
<br>
<b>4)</b> Then, run the game: <b>./ouRPG.pl</b>
<br>

If you're curious about the Windows CMD shell I use, it's called Cmder
