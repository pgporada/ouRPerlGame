# Usage

1. Currently the sounds only work on osx because I'm utilizing /usr/bin/afplay in several spots.
1. You will need some modules. I like to use cpanminus
1. Cpanminus - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/master/cpanm
1. To install Cpanminus on a Unix based system: `curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus`
1. To install the required modules: `sudo cpanm Term::ANSIColor Term::ExtendedColor Term::ReadKey Switch Term::Screen`
1. To run the game, grant the execute permission:  `chmod +x ouRPG.pl`
1. Finally, run the game: `./ouRPG.pl`
